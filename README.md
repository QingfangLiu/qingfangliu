## Selected Highlights

- Published in *Nature Communications* â€” used reinforcement learning to predict neuromodulation effects on brain imaging and behavior.
- Published in *Cerebral Cortex* â€” applied Bayesian models to understand the neural basis of self-control.
- Developed a dynamical system to simulate behavioral and neural activity in decision tasks.
