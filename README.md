## Hi there, I'm Qingfang Liu (刘晴方) 

Welcome to my GitHub.

I bring expertise from my background in psychology, computational cognitive modeling, and cognitive neuroscience, complemented by my ongoing efforts to stay up to date with advancements in data science and AI. My interdisciplinary training equips me with a unique perspective to understand human needs in the context of technology. It also enables me to recognize what current AI technologies lack—drawing from both computational and biological understandings of human cognition.

## About Me

- Actively transitioning from academic research to industry roles in **data science** and **AI**, especially in **healthcare**, **decision-making systems**, and **human-centered technologies**.
- Experienced in analyzing **large-scale behavioral and fMRI data**, with an emphasis on **latent representation models**.
- Strong foundation in **computational modeling**, **reinforcement learning**, **Bayesian inference**, and **generative methods**.
- Open to collaborating on applied projects, industry use cases, and cross-disciplinary tools.


## Current Projects

- [**Climate Risk Modeling in Bhutan**](https://github.com/QingfangLiu/bhutan_climate_modeling)  
  
  Collaborating on a project to predict extreme weather events (e.g., glacial lake outburst floods and monsoon floods) using meteorological data and geospatial analysis.

- [**Resting-State fMRI with Conditional VAE**] (https://github.com/QingfangLiu/vae-fmri-tms)  
  Applying conditional variational autoencoders (cVAEs) to identify latent structures in resting-state fMRI data, aiming to improve understanding of brain–behavior relationships.
