## Hi there, I'm Qingfang Liu (åˆ˜æ™´æ–¹) 

Welcome to my GitHub.

I specialize in cognitive science, neuroscience, and data science â€” with a current focus on applying machine learning and AI to real-world challenges in healthcare and human behavior.

## About Me

- Actively transitioning from academic research to industry roles in **data science** and **AI**, especially in **healthcare**, **decision-making systems**, and **human-centered technologies**.
- Experienced in analyzing **large-scale behavioral and fMRI data**, with an emphasis on **latent representation models**.
- Strong foundation in **computational modeling**, **reinforcement learning**, **Bayesian inference**, and **generative methods**.
- Open to collaborating on applied projects, industry use cases, and cross-disciplinary tools.


## Current Projects

- [**Climate Risk Modeling in Bhutan**](https://github.com/QingfangLiu/bhutan_climate_modeling)  
  
  Collaborating on a project to predict extreme weather events (e.g., glacial lake outburst floods and monsoon floods) using meteorological data and geospatial analysis.

- **Resting-State fMRI with Conditional VAE**  
  Applying conditional variational autoencoders (cVAEs) to identify latent structures in resting-state fMRI data, aiming to improve understanding of brainâ€“behavior relationships.
